# IONIC REACT STARTER (Typescript)
This is the standard Ionic React starter, with Typescript, a Caddy is added to serve the build folder. Caddy is used in place of the default start command because the default start command does not start the app in production mode.

See the template's readme.md for more information on why Caddy is used, and why the default start command is undesirable.
